            <h4>
                The government has filed a writ petition with the High Court seeking a stay on its verdict that reinstated first and second-class freedom fighter quota in government jobs. <br>
                <br>
                Assistant Attorney General Muhammad Saiful Alam filed the petition with the concerned branch of the Appellate Division on Sunday.
                <br>
                <br>
                On Wednesday, the High Court declared the decision to cancel the quota system, including the first and second-class freedom fighter quota in government jobs, invalid.
                <br>
                The High Court bench of Justice KM Kamrul Quader and Justice Khizir Hayat announced the verdict.
                <br>
                On October 4, 2018, the Ministry of Public Administration issued a circular to implement the cabinet's decision to abolish the existing quota system for direct recruitment to first and second-class posts in government jobs.
                <br>
                The Ministry of Public Administration issued the circular a day after the decision of the Cabinet to cancel the quota.
